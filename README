= MarshalDb

MarshalDb is a database-independent format for dumping and restoring data.  It complements the the database-independent schema format found in db/schema.rb.  The data is saved into db/marshal_db.zip.

This can be used as a replacement for mysqldump or pg_dump, but only for the databases typically used by Rails apps.  Users, permissions, schemas, triggers, and other advanced database features are not supported - by design.

Any database that has an ActiveRecord adapter should work.

== Usage

rake db:data:dump   ->   Dump contents of Rails database to db/marshal_db/
rake db:data:load   ->   Load contents of db/marshal_db/ into the database

== Credits

MarshalDb was created by Ricardo Chimal, Jr. of Heroku.  Heavy inspiration from YamlDb created by Orion Henry and Adam Wiggins of Heroku.
